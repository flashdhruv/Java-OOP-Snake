# Java-OOP-Snake
A recreation of the snake game from the earlier days, created using Java. 
The reason behind creating the game is to find a creative way to practice various OOP concepts in Java.
Additionally, it helped introduce Java's GUI. using JPanel, JFrame, etc helped bring this old game to life

# Current State
* The snake moves automatically as before. 
* the total score is equal to the number of apples eaten.
* The game ends if the snake eats itself or hits the edge.
* A Game Over Screen appears if any of the cases mentioned above occur.

# Future improvements
* Add more power-ups that affect the score differently.
* Add walls that may randomly appear everytime an apple is eaten.
* Add a start game button instead of the game starting as soon as the proram is run. 
* Add a Button that provides the option to restart game when the game ends.
